# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Let's find out what drives a customer to default on a bank loan 

The aim of this data analysis is to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments 
which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) 
at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

We want to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
