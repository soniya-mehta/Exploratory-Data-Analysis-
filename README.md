# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
 Using Exploratory Data Analysis to identify patterns and important variables that can explain loan default.


The aim of this data analysis is to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments 
which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) 
at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

The steps performed in the code script are
- Data understanding 
- Data cleaning 
- Correlation analysis 
- Feature engineering 
- Segmented univariate and bivariate analysis 
- Insights and key inferences
